The former UserMod is now Linux::usermod
I believe that's the correct name!
(for OS and Language)


NAME
       Linux::usermod - modify user accounts

SYNOPSIS
         use Linux::usermod;

         $user = Linux::usermod->new("username");

         $user->change($field_name, $new_value);
         $user->show($field_name);
         $user->lock;
         $user->unlock;


DESCRIPTION
       Linux::usermod is a simple package which change or return fields
       from /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files. It acts like
       usermod (with the main exception it is OOPerl program).
       The job is done entirely in change which returns(shows)
       the value of the field specified as a first argument. The
       second optional argument serves as a new value for the
       field. If password field is specified, You can use third
       argument for the value of salt which is 13 characters by
       default. The package implements a simple taint checking by
       'carping'(warning) for input data which is not any of the
       following: '!-\/\w\s+"'.
